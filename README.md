# Two_Domain_Allostery
This folder contains all the data and code used in the paper entitled "A parametrized two-domain thermodynamic model explains diverse mutational effects on protein allostery". Readers can easily identify the contents of each file following filenames and the code for generating the figures.

FCdata.txt and G102D_FC.txt contain the experimental fold change measurements for the 24 mutants.
leak_info.txt contains the average leakiness and s.e.m. of the leakiness measurements for the 23 mutants (no G102D).
Inferred_Post_Samples.txt containts the Bayesian posterior samples of the biophysical parameters inferred for the 23 mutants based on their fold change measurements.
the file "prior_data..." contains the prior predictive draws of parameters and their corresponding simulated fold change measurements.
the folder "scc_data..." contains the Bayesian posterior samples inferred for the prior predictive samples based on their simulated data.
